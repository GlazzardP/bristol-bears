Bristol Bears - A team selection game
I wanted to create a game where you can select a team from a given squad. To do this, I have used mock data to create a squad of players, all of whom cn be selected to play for the team. 

What I want to do next
Next, I want to be able to provide feedback based on the team selected. 

Additioanlly, I want greatl improve the styling, however, this is a lower priority.
